# Redstone Graphic Language

Welcome to the Redstone Graphic Language project! This repository aims to create a graphical descriptive language for simulating redstone circuits, inspired by Minecraft's redstone mechanics. Although the project is in its early stages, our goal is to provide a tool that allows users to visually construct and analyze complex redstone circuits.

## 📚 Project Overview

The Redstone Graphic Language is designed to:
- Represent redstone elements (levers, wires, repeaters, etc.) in a 3D space.
- Simulate the behavior of redstone circuits with a tick-based system.
- Allow users to define elements' states, positions, and orientations.

While development is still in progress, planned features include:
- Works like Minecraft redstone.
- A graphical interface for designing and simulating circuits.
- Advanced error handling for validating circuit configurations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To start working with the project locally, make sure you have:
- **Java 11** or a newer version installed.

### Installation
Currently, there is no stable release. To clone and explore the repository:

cd redy

More setup instructions will be added as development progresses.

## 🛠️ Usage

Since the project is under development, usage instructions will be documented here in future updates.
